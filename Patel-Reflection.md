I learnt that git amd github are two separate things. Git is more like a version control system where one can add different versions of code and various other repositories. While github is the home host of those repositories, basically like a cup for the coffee. Commitment is when a message is added when you submit changes. While pull request is a review of those changes. Overall github is a bit confusing, mostly the navigation, and i feel like might get harder to do once groups are assigned. But time will fix that.
